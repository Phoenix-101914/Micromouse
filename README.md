# Micromouse
Firmware for a Micromouse robot implementing the Flood Fill algorithm for autonomous maze solving. The current implementation focuses on grid-based path planning and navigation logic. Upcoming features include PID control for motor precision and integration with IR sensors for real-time wall detection and feedback control.
